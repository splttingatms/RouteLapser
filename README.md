# RouteLapser
**A .NET demo to create Google Street View hyperlapse videos from TCX routes.**

This console program demonstrates the ability to create hyperlapse videos from Google Street View images captured along GPS routes saved in TCX files. The project was made as a simple demo for myself to see the capabilities of the Google Street View API and to learn how to render videos using FFMPEG.

The project is not yet a consumable library and is in a rough state. Most of the variables are simply hard-coded so feel free to manipulate the values for your needs.
